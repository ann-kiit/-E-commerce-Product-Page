You should replace "product-image.jpg" with the actual file path of your product image.
In my case I used my file location.

For example:
if the image is located in the same directory as your HTML file and named "product.jpg", the HTML code would be:
<img src="product.jpg" alt="Product Image">

If the image is hosted on a web server with the URL "https://example.com/images/product.jpg", the HTML code would be:
<img src="https://example.com/images/product.jpg" alt="Product Image">
And then save your changes.
